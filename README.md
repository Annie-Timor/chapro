CHAPRO

Synopsis

CHAPRO is a library of functions that may be used to implement simulations of compression hearing-aid signal processing. Two different types of signal processing strategies are included: (1) gammatone filter-bank frequency analysis with instantaneous compression and (2) FIR filter-bank frequency analysis with automatic gain control. A modular design has been adopted to facilitate replacement of library functions with alternative signal-processing implementations.

Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation

The objective or this library is to provide an example of basic hearing-aid signal processing as a foundation for developing better methods.

Installation

Download repo from https://github.com/BTNRH/chapro. Makefiles are provided for building test programs at Linux or MinGW command lines. A solution file is provided in the VS9 folder for building under Visual Studio. Note: when running test programs under VS, set the "Working Directory" to "..". Test program inputs and outputs are located in the subdirectory "test".

API Reference
